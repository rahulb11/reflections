When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share the code with others and work on it collaboratively

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Might have to experiment code individually

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks - getting other's work and starting from there
    clones - creating a copy locally
    branches - starting something new from existing

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    can go offline and still see the differences between local master and origin/master
